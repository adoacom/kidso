英基根據一至六級調節級別機制 (點擊此處可參閱調節級別機制 - 只提供英文版本) 確定學生的特殊需要，為其提供三種主要選擇。第一種在幼稚園主流班別及中小學實施 (第一級及第二級)；第二種在部分中小學開設的學習支援中心實施 (第三級及第四級)；第三種在賽馬會善樂學校實施 (第五級及第六級)。該三項選擇詳情如下。

主流班別提供支援

很多有特殊教育需要而只需要微調教與學的學生可就讀任何幼稚園和學校的主流班別。只要獲得微調和少許支援，這些學生便能夠在這種學習環境下升讀正規課程。他們的問題是難以專注、語言及／或讀寫能力發展遲緩或自我管制有困難。專責老師或教學助理會利用少量時間為這個級別的學生提供支援。家長必需經由正規入學程序申請特殊教學。如果您的子女屬於這個類別，請與貴區的英基幼稚園或學校聯絡，與職員商討子女的入學事宜。","Types of provision

ESF offers three broad options for students with special educational needs, based upon identification of need using the ESF Levels of Adjustment 1 to 6. Firstly, within mainstream classes in kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools (Level 1 & 2), secondly with learning support centres in primary and some secondary schools (Levels 3 & 4) and thirdly within the Jockey Club Sarah Roe School (Levels 5 & 6). Further details of each of these options are outlined below.

Mainstream class with possible support
Many students whose special education needs require minimal teaching and learning adjustments are catered for within mainstream classes in all kindergartens and schools. These students are able to access the normal curriculum in these settings with minimal adjustment or support. In these settings students may be supported for limited amounts of time by specialist teachers or by educational assistants. Entry to this type of special education provision is through the normal school admissions process. If your child falls into this category you should approach the ESF kindergarten or school in your district and discuss your child’s enrolment with staff.

學習和注意力障礙原屬神經病學徵狀，包括讀寫障礙、計算障礙、記憶力障礙和注意力不足 / 注意力不足過度活躍，影響所及，會妨礙個人記憶、運用或輸出訊息的能力。受到這類障礙困擾的兒童，儘管智力往往高於常人，但在掌握閱讀、書寫和計算等能力上會出現困難。他們也可能不善社交和溝通，從而影響健康家庭關係和友情的發展。如果得不到適當的支援，這些兒童往往會被認為是「懶惰」、「不長進」，甚或「麻煩製造者」，導致自我形象低落，自認為「失敗者」。

受學習和注意力障礙困擾的人，很多都有特異的天賦，如富創造力、同情心、直覺敏銳、熱情、好動、有毅力，甚且別具不落窠臼的思考方式。不少成功人物都能克服這種種障礙，面對挑戰，發揮他們的天賦才能。一些世界知名的傑出思想家、藝術家和領袖，如愛迪生、愛因斯坦、羅丹和邱吉爾，據說都有學習障礙。
