As long as your baby is healthy and happy, there&rsquo;s no reason not to include them in the festivities surrounding the winter holidays. But there is a right way to include your little one in a party, and about a thousand wrong ways. Let&rsquo;s get a few of the most important points spelled out right. Things to remember... The most crucial thing to remember is that for a baby, Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Eve are just another day and night when they want to be fed as usual, be changed promptly when sporting a dirty diaper, be held and rocked as needed, and to sleep when tired. Routine is crucial for an infant and breaking their routine just because you say it&rsquo;s time to party doesn&rsquo;t make for a great start to the new year. Unfortunately, if your baby hates loud noises, needs to sleep a certain length of time and in certain conditions, or has any other issues that simply preclude being around lots of people and lots of commotion (a weakened immune system, for example), then the party might be over before it starts this year. Sorry. The second note to hammer home before we get to some of the positive points (remember, this is a time to celebrate!) is that an experienced childcare provider needs to be present and also totally sober. New Year&rsquo;s Eve especially means booze, and often lots of it. That&rsquo;s great for all the responsible adults enjoying the party, but at least one of those adults had better be enjoying no more than a single glass of celebratory champagne. If a parent of any baby present at a party is not the designated caregiver on call, then another experienced, sensible and sober adult must be specifically designated as the babysitter ahead of time. Don&rsquo;t ever assume someone will just &ldquo;take care of it&rdquo;; don&rsquo;t rely on that favorite aunt or loving grandfather or anyone else unless they have been specifically tasked with taking care of your little one! You need to have everything a caregiver might need laid out before a party starts, from milk or formula, diapers, clothing changes, etc. and you need to have discussed your child&rsquo;s needs in detail. If you want to enjoy your party, plan for all the baby-related things that could ruin it ahead of time! There - now we&rsquo;ve dealt with the more unpleasant topics. Let&rsquo;s talk about how to party with that baby! Keep hands clean Many babies enjoy motion, music, laughter and attention. If yours is one of those, then they can dive right into the celebrations; just make sure people wash their hands before holding your child. And when your baby is being held by lots of people in a short period of time, you should take the added step of washing their little hands, too. Use a quality wipe or have someone help you gently scrub those paws with mild soap and water every half hour or so, because every time your baby&rsquo;s little fingers go in that little mouth, they might be ingesting germs that were lurking on shared platters of appetizers, toilet seats, cigars, and so on. But as long as you&rsquo;re keeping your baby clean and as long as he or she is happy, party on. Create a quiet room If your baby is more sensitive to noise and commotion, then arrange for a more sensible party atmosphere. One great way to do this is to designate a room as a space for a more restrained celebration. Let the good times roll throughout the house, but explain that in this one area, all are welcome, but not at the same time. In this quieter, calmer room, people can rotate a few at a time rather than having the baby surrounded by all the action. Everyone who wants to enjoy Junior can do so, and Junior need not be subjected to the full force of a holiday bash. You can keep separate, smaller plates of snacks in this room, offer a tray of nonalcoholic beverages, play music you know your child likes, and so on. Celebrate a little early When the time draws near to ring in the New Year, remember that your newborn really couldn&rsquo;t care less about what the calendar says. If your baby is on a schedule, you have already overcome one of the greatest challenges new parents face. Don&rsquo;t screw it up just to be awake when the clock strikes midnight! Instead consider seeing if your friends and family would be amenable to simply &ldquo;moving&rdquo; the New Year earlier. This isn&rsquo;t as crazy as it sounds: just pretend you&rsquo;re in a different time zone and start the New Year a few hours early (AKA go to bed at the usual time, but after a bit more partying than usual). You can even find a celebration occurring at midnight in another part of the world on TV or online and celebrate along with those folks. (For example, Sydney is 3 hours ahead of Hong Kong, while Fiji and New Zealand are 5 hours ahead.) You&rsquo;ll find most people will love this idea, especially as your older guests will likely be glad to have an early evening anyway, and the younger folks can always shuttle off to another party and celebrate two New Year&rsquo;s Eve midnights in the same evening!</strong></p>\r\n','MK.jpg,03(pp_w1200_h951).png,top01.jpg,top02.jpg,top03.jpg','1','2015-02-10 07:53:03'),(2,'豐富，理智和清醒的成年人','Babies are always the life of any party','<p>寶寶總是任何一方的生活，與家人和朋友想要去把握和擁抱你的小傢伙，並通過孩子身邊所有的享受和慶祝。只要你的寶寶是健康的，快樂的，沒有理由不包括在周邊冬季假期的慶祝活動。但是有一個正確的方式，包括你的小一的聚會，大約有一千錯誤的方法。讓我們幾個闡明權的最重要的兩點。需要記住的事情......最關鍵的是要記住的是，對於一個嬰兒，聖誕節和除夕只是另一天，當他們想餵像往常一樣晚上，及時改變運動臟尿布的時候，舉行和震撼的需要，並睡累了的時候。常規是嬰兒重要的，打破日常的，只是因為你說這是一次一方不為一個偉大的開始新的一年。不幸的是，如果你的寶寶不喜歡大聲喧嘩，需要睡覺一定的長度和時間在一定的條件下，還是有一個簡單的排除被周圍的很多人很多騷動的任何其他問題（削弱免疫系統為例），然後它在今年開始之前，工黨可能會結束。抱歉。第二個音符錘回家之前，我們得到了一些積極點（請記住，這是一個值得慶祝的時刻！）是一位經驗豐富的育兒提供商需要存在，也完全清醒。除夕特別是指酒，常常很多。這是偉大的所有負責任的成年人享受著黨，但至少有一個與成人最好可以享受不低於慶祝香檳單一的玻璃等等。如果任何嬰兒出席黨父母不在調用指定的照顧者，然後又經驗豐富，理智和清醒的成年人必須明確指定為提前保姆。永遠不要認為別人會只是&ldquo;照顧它&rdquo;;不依賴於喜愛的阿姨或爺爺愛好或其他任何人，除非他們已經專門考慮您的小傢伙照顧任務！你需要擁有的一切照顧者可能會派對開始前需要擺出來，從牛奶或配方，尿布，衣服的變化，等等，你需要有詳細討論孩子的需要。如果你想享受你的派對，打算為所有寶寶有關的東西，可以提前毀掉的時間吧！還有 - 現在，我們已經處理了更多的不愉快的話題。讓我們來談談如何與寶寶派對！保持雙手清潔，許多嬰兒喜歡運動，音樂，笑聲和關注。如果你是其中之一，那麼他們可以深入到慶祝活動;只是讓抱著孩子之前，確保人們洗手。當你的寶寶正在在短時間內舉行很多人，你應該洗自己的小手的加一步了。使用質量擦拭或讓別人幫你輕輕刷洗那些爪子用溫和的肥皂和水，每半小時左右，因為每次寶寶的小手指去那個小口，他們可能攝入的細菌是被潛伏在開胃共享拼盤，馬桶，雪茄等。但只要你保持你的寶寶清潔，只要他或她是幸福的，在黨。創造一個安靜的房間。如果你的寶寶是喧囂和騷動更加敏感，然後安排一個更明智的派對氣氛。一個偉大的方式做，這是指定一個房間作為空間更內斂的慶祝。讓美好時光，整個房子，但解釋說，在這一方面，都是值得歡迎的，但不是在同一時間。在此更安靜，更平靜房間時，人們可以旋轉數在時刻而不是由所有的動作所包圍的嬰兒。大家誰想要享受少年能做到這一點，和初級不必受到的節日慶典的全部力量。你可以保持獨立的小吃，小一點的盤子在這個房間裡，提供非酒精飲料的托盤，玩你知道你的孩子喜歡音樂，等等。慶祝早了一點當時間臨近新年響，記住，你的新生兒真的一點也不在乎什麼日曆說。如果你的寶寶是一個時間表，你已經克服了新的父母所面臨的最大挑戰之一。不要搞砸了只是為了保持清醒，當午夜的鐘聲敲響！相反，考慮看，如果你的朋友和家人會服從簡單地&ldquo;搬&rdquo;新年較早。這並不像聽起來那麼瘋狂：假裝你是在一個不同的時區，並開始新的一年幾小時的早期（AKA上床在老時間，但比平常多一點派對後）。你甚至可以找到一個慶祝活動發生在午夜在世界的另一部分在電視上或網上和那些人一起慶祝。 （例如，悉尼領先香港3個小時，而斐濟和新西蘭5小時領先。）你會發現大多數人會喜歡這樣的想法，尤其是你的老客人可能會很高興有一個傍晚反正和年輕人們總是可以穿梭過另一方，並在當天晚上慶祝2除夕午夜！</p>\r\n','<p><strong>Babies are always the life of any party, with friends and family wanting to hold and cuddle your little one and pass the baby around for all to enjoy and celebrate.

As long as your baby is healthy and happy, there&rsquo;s no reason not to include them in the festivities surrounding the winter holidays. But there is a right way to include your little one in a party, and about a thousand wrong ways. Let&rsquo;s get a few of the most important points spelled out right. Things to remember... The most crucial thing to remember is that for a baby, Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Eve are just another day and night when they want to be fed as usual, be changed promptly when sporting a dirty diaper, be held and rocked as needed, and to sleep when tired. Routine is crucial for an infant and breaking their routine just because you say it&rsquo;s time to party doesn&rsquo;t make for a great start to the new year. Unfortunately, if your baby hates loud noises, needs to sleep a certain length of time and in certain conditions, or has any other issues that simply preclude being around lots of people and lots of commotion (a weakened immune system, for example), then the party might be over before it starts this year. Sorry. The second note to hammer home before we get to some of the positive points (remember, this is a time to celebrate!) is that an experienced childcare provider needs to be present and also totally sober. New Year&rsquo;s Eve especially means booze, and often lots of it. That&rsquo;s great for all the responsible adults enjoying the party, but at least one of those adults had better be enjoying no more than a single glass of celebratory champagne. If a parent of any baby present at a party is not the designated caregiver on call, then another experienced, sensible and sober adult must be specifically designated as the babysitter ahead of time. Don&rsquo;t ever assume someone will just &ldquo;take care of it&rdquo;; don&rsquo;t rely on that favorite aunt or loving grandfather or anyone else unless they have been specifically tasked with taking care of your little one! You need to have everything a caregiver might need laid out before a party starts, from milk or formula, diapers, clothing changes, etc. and you need to have discussed your child&rsquo;s needs in detail. If you want to enjoy your party, plan for all the baby-related things that could ruin it ahead of time! There - now we&rsquo;ve dealt with the more unpleasant topics. Let&rsquo;s talk about how to party with that baby! Keep hands clean Many babies enjoy motion, music, laughter and attention. If yours is one of those, then they can dive right into the celebrations; just make sure people wash their hands before holding your child. And when your baby is being held by lots of people in a short period of time, you should take the added step of washing their little hands, too. Use a quality wipe or have someone help you gently scrub those paws with mild soap and water every half hour or so, because every time your baby&rsquo;s little fingers go in that little mouth, they might be ingesting germs that were lurking on shared platters of appetizers, toilet seats, cigars, and so on. But as long as you&rsquo;re keeping your baby clean and as long as he or she is happy, party on. Create a quiet room If your baby is more sensitive to noise and commotion, then arrange for a more sensible party atmosphere. One great way to do this is to designate a room as a space for a more restrained celebration. Let the good times roll throughout the house, but explain that in this one area, all are welcome, but not at the same time. In this quieter, calmer room, people can rotate a few at a time rather than having the baby surrounded by all the action. Everyone who wants to enjoy Junior can do so, and Junior need not be subjected to the full force of a holiday bash. You can keep separate, smaller plates of snacks in this room, offer a tray of nonalcoholic beverages, play music you know your child likes, and so on. Celebrate a little early When the time draws near to ring in the New Year, remember that your newborn really couldn&rsquo;t care less about what the calendar says. If your baby is on a schedule, you have already overcome one of the greatest challenges new parents face. Don&rsquo;t screw it up just to be awake when the clock strikes midnight! Instead consider seeing if your friends and family would be amenable to simply &ldquo;moving&rdquo; the New Year earlier. This isn&rsquo;t as crazy as it sounds: just pretend you&rsquo;re in a different time zone and start the New Year a few hours early (AKA go to bed at the usual time, but after a bit more partying than usual). You can even find a celebration occurring at midnight in another part of the world on TV or online and celebrate along with those folks. (For example, Sydney is 3 hours ahead of Hong Kong, while Fiji and New Zealand are 5 hours ahead.)
